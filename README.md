## Rules

This game is a simple one-player puzzle. The game starts with a grid of squares,
some of which contain *trees* (🌲). The goal of the game is to place *tents* (⛺)
in the *empty* squares (⬜) in such a way that the following conditions are met:

- Rule 1) No two tents are adjacent, even diagonally.
- Rule 2) The number of tents in each row, and in each column, matches the
  expected numbers given around the sides of the grid.
- Rule 3) There are exactly as many tents as trees.
- Rule 4) Each tent must be orthogonally adjacent (horizontally or vertically,
  but not diagonally) to at least one tree and vice versa.

Besides, it is also possible to place *grass* (🟩) in a square, indicating that
you are sure there is no tent on this square. The *grass* square gives a clue,
but it is not necessary to use it to win the game.

In summary, the game uses 4 different squares:

- empty (⬜ or ' ')
- tree (🌲 or 'x')
- tent (⛺ or '*')
- grass (🟩 or '-')

By convention, the square in the *i*-th row and *j*-th column of the grid is
referred to as the coordinate (i,j), and the coordinate (0,0) corresponds to the
top left corner. The dimension of the default game is 8x8.

## Example: Default Game

As an example, let's see the instance of the game, considered thereafter as the
*default* game:

```

```

Hereafter, its solution:

## About the Rule 4

Note that the Rule 4) is not exactly formulated in the same way in the original
game. According to <a
href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/doc/tents.html">Simon
Tatham</a>, the rule 4) is defined by a *matching* condition:

> It is possible to match tents to trees so that each tree is orthogonally
> adjacent to its own tent (but may also be adjacent to other tents).

Another way of phrasing the tree/tent matching criterion is to say that the
bipartite adjacency graph between trees and tents has a perfect matching. And
there is no trivial algorithm to check this condition (see <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopcroft%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm">
Hopcroft–Karp algorithm</a>).

Here is an example that satisfies the Rule 4) as we have stated it, but does not
satisfy the *matching criterion* formulated in the original rule.

```

The variant of the Rule 4) we have chosen is a local criterion, that is much easier to implement.

## Programming Interface

The game interface is divided into 2 files:

- Basic Game Functions: @ref game.h
- Auxiliarry Game Functions: @ref game_aux.h

It manipulates the *opaque* @ref game structure by means of pointers or const pointers (@ref cgame).

## Error Policy

There are many different ways to deal with program errors... Concerning the
"game" library, we suppose that function calls to these interfaces (*game.h*,
...) must systematically be made with valid arguments (see preconditions). Also,
the behavior of the library is not defined if a third-party program passes bad
arguments to it. In practice, this means that the responsibility of checking
that the arguments are valid is relieved to the high-level program (*game_text*,
...).

In order to debug your program easily, we recommand to use the `assert()` macro,
as it allows you to activate checks only in DEBUG mode and not in RELEASE mode.
More precisely, if you pass the `-DNDEBUG` option at compilation time, the macro
`assert()` generates no code, and hence does nothing at all.

For example:

```C
#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

/** duplicate an array of integer and return it */
int* copyArray(int size, int * array)
{
  assert(size > 0);                           // check size parameter
  assert(array != NULL);                      // check array parameter
  int * newarray = malloc(size*sizeof(int));  // allocate memory for a new array
  assert(newarray != NULL);                   // check memory allocation
  for(int i = 0 ; i < size ; i++)             // copy array values
    newarray[i] = array[i];
  return newarray;
}
```
